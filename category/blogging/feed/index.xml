<p>The goal of this new editor is to make adding rich content to WordPress simple and enjoyable. This whole post is composed of <em>pieces of content</em>â€”somewhat similar to LEGO bricksâ€”that you can move around and interact with. Move your <a href="#">cursor around</a> and youâ€™ll notice the different blocks light up with outlines and arrows. Press the arrows to reposition blocks quickly, without fearing about losing things in the process of copying and pasting.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-dots"/>



<p>Headings are separate blocks as well, which helps with the outline and organization of your content. What you are reading now is a <strong>text block</strong> the most basic block of all. The text block has its own controls to be moved freely around the post&#8230;</p>



<ul><li>Text &amp; Headings</li><li>Images &amp; Videos</li><li>Galleries</li><li>Embeds, like YouTube, Tweets, or other WordPress posts.</li><li>Layout blocks, like Buttons, Hero Images, Separators, etc.</li><li>And <em>Lists</em> like this one of course <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li></ul>



<hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-wide"/>



<h2>Visual Editing</h2>



<p>A huge benefit of blocks is that you can edit them in place and manipulate your content directly. Instead of having fields for editing things like the source of a quote, or the text of a button, you can directly change the content. Try editing the following quote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away. </p><cite>Matt Mullenweg, 2017</cite></blockquote>



<p>The information corresponding to the source of the quote is a separate text field, similar to captions under images, so the structure of the quote is protected even if you select, modify, or remove the source. Itâ€™s always easy to add it back.</p>



<h2>Media Rich</h2>



<p>If you combine the new <strong>wide</strong> and <strong>full-wide</strong> alignments with galleries, you can create a very media rich layout, very quickly:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://everse.deothemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/post_img_11-min-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-41"/><figcaption>Credit: Michael Murray</figcaption></figure>



<p>Sure, the full-wide image can be pretty big. But sometimes the image is worth it. The above is a gallery with just two images. Itâ€™s an easier way to create visually appealing layouts, without having to deal with floats. You can also easily convert the gallery back to individual images again, by using the block switcher.</p>



<h4>Conclusion</h4>



<p>Any block can opt into these alignments. The embed block has them also, and is responsive out of the box. The information corresponding to the source of the quote is a separate text field, similar to captions under images.</p>
